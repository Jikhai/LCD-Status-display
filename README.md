This is a fork of https://github.com/elektrongeek/CPU-Serial-output-for-arduino.
For my personnal use.
I intend on usind a small lcd screen to display basic data about the machine and it's state, and embed it in a 5"1/4 Bay.
The program runs on C# and sends data via Serial communication, to an arduino device.
